Ilaro.Admin
===========

Ilaro.Admin creates for you admin panel using only POCO classes.

Project was inspired by [Django admin site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/).

Requirements:
- POCO classes (or pseudo POCO)
- Entity Framework context - for now, but in future I delete this
- And that's it!

Off course you can configure your POCO classes with attrbibutes to get result as you want, but your clean and nice classes becomes dirty, so in future I add fluent configuration.
